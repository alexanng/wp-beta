# Week 1 Deliverables
## Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?
Today across the country our cities are suffering from a growing homeless problem. Attempts to address the problem only seem to proliferate the issue. San Francisco is in the midst of a homeless crisis, throwing $30Million at the problem only to find homelessness increase by 17%. 

The problem is not lack of funding, but lack of human understanding. Issues facing people on street only perpetuate their homeless state. These issues are:

- No form of identification
- No bank account
- No acccessible labor market
- Vulnerable to wage theft
- Learned helplessness (dejected from society)
- No civic engagement or social capital

## What demographics do you serve? What is the size of the market?
We are serving the 552,830 people who identify as homeless in the United States and the many citizens who are negatively affected by the overwhemling presence of encampments.

## What other solutions are currently being used to afdress this problem? (other companies, workarounds, systems or procersses that can complete with or substitute your product)
Shelters and non-profits that provide services to the homless, however, none are addressing the issues stated above. There are a few homeless-to-work programs in the United States, but their draw back is that they pay their workers in cash and do not adress the non-accessible labor market for long-term work. We have spoken with the creators of Hypergive, a blockchain giving solutions that could support the Wolf Pack project. 


## What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?
