# Week 1 Deliverables
## Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?
Today across the country our cities are suffering from a growing homeless problem. Attempts to address the problem only seem to proliferate the issue. San Francisco is in the midst of a homeless crisis, throwing $30Million at the problem only to find homelessness increase by 17%. 

The problem is not lack of funding, but lack of human understanding. Issues facing people on street only perpetuate their homeless state. These issues are:

- No form of identification
- No bank account
- No acccessible labor market
- Vulnerable to wage theft
- Learned helplessness (dejected from society)
- No civic engagement or social capital

## What other solutions are currently being used to afdress this problem? (other companies, workarounds, systems or procersses that can complete with or substitute your product)



## What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?
